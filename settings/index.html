<h1>LightwaveRF</h1>
        <p>This LightwaveRF app has been designed to act as a hub between your LightwaveRF transmitters (remotes, wireless switches, door bells etc) and your LightwaveRF recievers (wired lights, wired plug sockets, etc) as most of LightwaveRF devices are one way i.e Transmit to reciever without anyfeed back the app will not know know if a user manuallly turns off a lightswitch for example.</p>
        <p>Homey will use 1 of 6 avaliable pairing memories of reciever,  it is possible to pair a device more than once and if you find you have used up all of the pairing memories please read the documentation of your device on how to reset the memory.</p>
        <p>WIth devices with more than one set of switching, such as the 2 gang dimmer both switches need to be paired individually</p>
